This is my setup for the oneplus 13 codename "dodge". I have built SunOs-Project sucessfully using this kernel setup. 
Except 3 configs due to compatibility issues with the custom rom. 
CONFIG_FHANDLE has to be set to n
CONFIG_SYSVIPC has to be set to n
CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD has to be set to n
I will update when I have a solution to this configs.
